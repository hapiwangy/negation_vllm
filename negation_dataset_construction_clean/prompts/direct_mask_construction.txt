You are given a list of dictionaries as input. Focus on the questions that are under "neg_q".

Your task is to perform a deterministic, multi-step transformation on each question and output structured results.
You MUST follow the steps in order. No step may be skipped or merged.

================================================
Step 1 — Split the question into parts
================================================
- Find the FIRST occurrence of a standalone negation trigger.

A negation trigger is ONE of the following:
1) The standalone word "not"
2) The standalone word "no"
3) A single-word negation contraction that semantically contains "not"
   (e.g., "isn't", "aren't", "wasn't", "weren't", "don't", "doesn't",
    "didn't", "can't", "couldn't", "won't", "wouldn't", "shouldn't")

Matching rules:
- Match whole word only.
- Do NOT expand, normalize, or rewrite contractions.
- Treat the entire contraction as ONE token.

- Part A = the exact substring BEFORE the negation trigger.
- Part B = the negation trigger itself (original surface form).
- Part C = the exact substring AFTER the negation trigger,
           EXCLUDING the final question mark "?".

If there is NO negation trigger:
- Part A = the exact substring BEFORE the final "?"
- Part B = ""
- Part C = ""

Do NOT paraphrase, reorder, normalize, or infer text. Only split.

================================================
Step 2 — Trim whitespace
================================================
For Part A, Part B, and Part C:
- Remove ALL leading and trailing whitespace.

================================================
Step 3 — Extract words (SOURCE OF TRUTH)
================================================
You MUST extract words from each trimmed part (A, B, C) by scanning left-to-right.

A WORD is defined as ONE of the following:
1) A number token: one or more digits
   Pattern: [0-9]+
2) A letter token with optional internal apostrophes
   Pattern: [A-Za-z]+ ( ' [A-Za-z]+ )*

Rules:
- Internal apostrophes are allowed and count as ONE word
  (e.g., "man's", "isn't", "don't").
- Hyphens and other symbols BREAK words.
- Do NOT split by whitespace.
- Do NOT create empty tokens.
- Punctuation is never part of a word.

You MUST output the extracted tokens explicitly as:

part_words = {
  "A": [...],
  "B": [...],
  "C": [...],
}

================================================
Step 4 — Compute part_lengths
================================================
part_lengths MUST be computed ONLY as:

part_lengths.X = length of part_words.X

for X in {A, B, C}.

No other counting method is allowed.

================================================
Output Format (JSON ONLY)
================================================
Return a list in the same order as the input.
Each item MUST include ALL fields below:

{
  "neg_q": "<original question>",
  "part_lengths": {
    "A": <integer>,
    "B": <integer>,
    "C": <integer>
  },
}

================================================
Final Constraints
================================================
- Only analyze the "question" field.
- Use ONLY the first negation trigger.
- Do NOT add explanations, comments, or extra text.
- Return valid JSON only.

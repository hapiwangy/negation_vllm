You are an expert for Negation-based Visual Question Answering (NegVQA).

Task:
Convert a WH-question into a valid negated WH-question while keeping the same WH-word, overall structure, and visual scope.
The negated question must ask for the semantic complement of the original query (i.e., what is explicitly NOT true given the original question).
If the negation cannot stay bounded, meaningful, and within the same semantic role, output “not_applicable”.

========================================
OUTPUT FORMAT (minimal)
========================================
Return ONLY a JSON list.
Each item MUST follow EXACTLY:
{
  "id": <image_id>,
  "q": <original_question>,
  "neg_q": <negated_or_not_applicable>,
  "a": <same_answer>,
  "type": <AC|AT|CO|EX|not_applicable>
}

========================================
VALID NEGATION TYPES
========================================
1. **AC (Action)**
For actions, holding, wearing, using, interacting.
- “What is the man holding?” → “What is the man not holding?”

2. **AT (Attribute)**
For visible color/material/shape/texture/category.
- “What color is the jacket?” → “What is not the color of the jacket?”

3. **CO (Comparison)**
Only when the question asks for a bounded alternative (e.g., direction).
- “Which direction is X?” → “Which direction is not X?”

4. **EX (Existence)**
Only allowed pattern:
- “Where is X?” → “Where is there no X?”
X must be singular.

========================================
ALWAYS RETURN “not_applicable” FOR:
========================================
1. **Identity questions**
(what is this / what is that object / what kind/type is this / what is the fruit / what device is this)
→ Negation creates an unbounded set.

========================================
GENERAL RULES
========================================
- Keep the same WH-word and overall syntactic structure.
- Prefer placing the negation immediately after the auxiliary or copula
  (e.g., “is / are / does”) and before the queried noun phrase,
  rather than at the end of the question.
- Do not add information or make inferences.
- Negation must remain visually grounded and bounded.
- Negation must denote the semantic complement of the original queried set.
- “a” (answer) must be identical to the original.

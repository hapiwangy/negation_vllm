Your task: Rewrite each yes/no question into EXACTLY ONE soft-negation version.

The goal is to produce a question that is a TRUE semantic negation
(or contradiction) of the original yes/no condition,
while staying in the SAME semantic domain.

==================================================
1. Core Requirement (highest priority)
==================================================
The rewritten question MUST:
- Contradict the original yes/no meaning
- Preserve the same subject, object, and situation
- Remain a yes/no question
- Be answerable from the same evidence as the original

The negated question must flip the truth condition of the original.

==================================================
2. Forbidden Words (strict, zero tolerance)
==================================================
You may NOT use:
- not, no, n’t, never, none, nobody, nothing
- any word containing these substrings

If any forbidden substring appears, the output is invalid.

==================================================
3. Allowed Soft-Negation Strategies
==================================================

You MAY use ONE of the following strategies per question:

(A) Absence / Exclusion (preferred for existence questions)
- lack of
- absence of
- absent from
- missing
- free from
- excluded from
- barren of
- denied of

(B) Action Negation (preferred for actions)
Use forms that deny the action itself, NOT its outcome:
- refrain from
- avoid
- cease to
- fail to
- struggle to
- omit to
- refuse to

Avoid outcome-only interpretations where possible.

(C) Attribute / State Weakening
- lack of
- short of
- devoid of
- deprived of
- deficient in
- insufficient in
- scarce in
- void of
- fall short of

(D) Contrastive Identity / Comparison (preferred for identity)
- other than
- different from
- instead of
- rather than
- as opposed to

==================================================
4. Semantic Domain Rules (MANDATORY)
==================================================

(4a) Existence / SOME / ANY questions
Examples:
- "Is there X?"
- "Are there any X?"
- "Are some of the X Y?"

You MUST express absence or lack.
DO NOT use quantity softening.

Valid:
- "Is there a lack of X?"
- "Are X absent?"
- "Is there an absence of X?"

Invalid:
- "Are there fewer X than expected?"

--------------------------------------------------

(4b) Exact-number questions (two, both, three, etc.)
You MAY use:
- "fewer than <number>"

Example:
- "Are there three sheep?"
→ "Are there fewer than three sheep?"

--------------------------------------------------

(4c) ALL / EVERY / BOTH questions
You MUST indicate that some members lack the property.

Example:
- "Are all the flowers white?"
→ "Are some of the flowers lacking whiteness?"

--------------------------------------------------

(4d) Action questions (doing / performing / engaging)
You MUST negate the ACTION ITSELF.

Do NOT shift to:
- resources
- ability
- external conditions

Prefer:
- refraining from the action
- avoiding the action
- ceasing to perform the action

--------------------------------------------------

(4e) Identity / Category questions
You MUST stay in the same identity domain.

Prefer contrastive identity forms:
- "other than"
- "different from"

Avoid vague property loss unless identity is truly gradable.

==================================================
5. Naturalness (secondary priority)
==================================================
The sentence must be grammatical and understandable.
Slight awkwardness is acceptable.

Negation correctness is MORE IMPORTANT than fluency.

==================================================
6. Final Validation Checklist
==================================================
Before producing the output, verify:

[ ] No forbidden words or substrings  
[ ] True semantic negation of the original  
[ ] Same objects, actions, and context  
[ ] Existence → absence/lack (Rule 4a)  
[ ] Actions → action negation (Rule 4d)  
[ ] ALL/BOTH → some members lack property  
[ ] Identity preserved (Rule 4e)  
[ ] No new entities introduced  

==================================================
7. Output Format (STRICT)
==================================================
Return ONLY a JSON list.

Each item MUST follow EXACTLY:
- do not add any more symbol like " \\ " in the json format
{
  "id": "<image_id>",
  "q": "<original_question>",
  "neg_q": "<soft_negated_question>",
  "a": "<yes|no>",
  "neg_a": "<yes|no>",
  "neg_type": "soft"
}

Rules for answers:
- "neg_a" MUST be the flipped value of "a"
- yes → no
- no → yes

========================
8. ADDITIONAL LOGICAL VALIDATION (DO NOT SKIP)
========================
In addition to all previous requirements, each negated question MUST satisfy
a strict truth-condition flip relative to the original question.

This is a semantic requirement, not a surface-level rewrite.

Before finalizing a negated question, perform the following internal validation:

1. Assume the original question is TRUE in a given situation.
   Ask: under the same situation, would the negated question also be TRUE?
   - If YES → this is INVALID and must be rewritten.

2. Assume the original question is FALSE in the same situation.
   Ask: under that situation, would the negated question be TRUE?
   - If NO → this is INVALID and must be rewritten.

Only produce the negated question if BOTH conditions above are satisfied.

Paraphrases, synonym substitutions, or strengthened confirmations
(e.g., "enough" → "sufficient", or restating daylight in another form)
do NOT count as negation and are strictly forbidden.

If the negated question could ever be true at the same time as the original question,
it is NOT a valid negation.

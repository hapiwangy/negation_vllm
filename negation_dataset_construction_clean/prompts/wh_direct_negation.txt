You are an expert for Negation-based Visual Question Answering (NegVQA).

Task:
Convert a WH-question into a negated WH-question while keeping the same WH-word,
overall syntactic structure, and visual scope.

ALL questions must be negated.
Do NOT output "not_applicable" under any circumstance.

The negated question must ask for the semantic complement of the original query
(i.e., what is explicitly NOT true given the original question),
while preserving the same semantic role.

========================================
OUTPUT FORMAT (minimal)
========================================
Return ONLY a JSON list.

Each item MUST follow EXACTLY:
{
  "id": <image_id>,
  "q": <original_question>,
  "neg_q": <negated_question>,
  "a": <same_answer>,
  "type": <AC|AT|CO|EX>
}

========================================
VALID NEGATION TYPES
========================================
1. AC (Action)
Actions such as holding, wearing, using, interacting.
Example:
"What is the man holding?" → "What is the man not holding?"

2. AT (Attribute)
Visible attributes such as color, material, shape, texture, size, or category.
Example:
"What color is the jacket?" → "What is not the color of the jacket?"

3. CO (Comparison)
Bounded alternatives such as direction or relative position.
Example:
"Which direction is X facing?" → "Which direction is X not facing?"

4. EX (Existence)
Only allowed pattern:
"Where is X?" → "Where is there no X?"
Treat X as singular.

========================================
GENERAL RULES
========================================
- Keep the same WH-word and overall sentence structure.
- Place negation immediately after the auxiliary or copula
  (e.g., is / are / does / do / can).
- Do not add new information or make inferences.
- Negation must remain visually grounded.
- Negation must target the same semantic role as the original question.
- The answer field "a" must be identical to the original answer.
